## **Intro**
Good Afternoon! Thank you for this opportunity. I am Bosukonda Srinivas Chandra. I have done my graduation in B.Tech from Parul University in Computer Science Engineering specialized with Big Data Analytics. 

Through out my academic journey, I have build strong foundation on data analytics and modeling. Last winter I have done an online internship where I have streamlined a database migration into data warehouse. I have worked on personal projects which demonstrate my skillset in Azure cloud. Recently I have achieved a certification upon the completion of a Data Engineering bootcamp. 

I believe my mix of cloud experience, data handling skills and clear communication makes me a good fit for this position.
## **Why Payroll?**
- I want to work in payroll because it is the type of work i find interesting. Payroll is a crucial part of any organization's operations. It interest me how payroll has a direct impact on peoples life.
- From data perspective, it involves working w/ sensitive data, managing data systems integrations, automation. The responsibility, accountability it demands matches my qualities.
- Domain which can help build strong communication and service-oriented skills

## **Payroll Responsibilities**
- Monitoring employees worked hours during a payroll time period.
- Calculating pay on bi, four-weekly or monthly basis.
- Managing national and state tax deductions.
- Managing pay based on leaves of an employees such as sick leave, annual leave, unpaid leave, maternity leave.
- Setting up pay for new members who have joined the organization.
- Assisting employee's queries in respect of pay and tax deductions.
- It's not just about ensuring employees are paid on time, But also the pay is accurate and legit.
## **Strengths & Weaknesses**
- Adaptability & Learn Fast: I like to learn tools which I feel can make impact on workloads.
  I used to only work in azure for DE workloads. But recently I have transitioned into GCP. The reason why I have transitioned was my student subscription of azure was about be expire, then I came to notice that GCP also provides a 300$ trail for newly registered accounts. With in No-time I have made myself exposed to core products for DE, There is still a lot to learn. But it's a start.

- Tendency to be Self-Reliant: I Often try to solve everything on my own, which can slow things down. Now, I have adapted to collaborate better ask early whenever I feel stuck. 
  This mindset helped me a lot when I was working on bootcamp's weekly assignments to submit within due time.
  I used to reach my fellow peers in bootcamp, share them my approach of solving it and seek their thoughts and hints.

## **Challenge Faced & Dealt with**
One challenge I can think of is when I was working on one of the assignments which involved hands-on lab with Apache Spark. The module i was specifically working was bucketing data on a high cardinality column to make aggregations and joins faster.

At that time I was using my local system with docker. I have written a spark job that performs bucketing. When it's ran, the job used to take longer than usual and ultimately fail.

Then to find root cause, I have sampled data with limited records and performed the bucketing which was successful. I have sampled some more records, It worked fine.

Then It hit me that spark is an in-memory computation framework. So, I have again considered the entire dataset to perform bucketing on it. But this time i considered monitoring resource utilization, I open task manager and no surprise system's RAM usage went above 95%. I realized i needed more RAM to perform that task.

So, I have considered Google Compute Engine, replicated the same setup using docker but this time I have configured system with more ram i.e 32GB.

This time, spark job ran successfully and bucketed the data.

Lesson: Configuration of systems matter when working with large amounts data, Better go for cloud vm's as it provides scalability on demand.

## **Where do you see yourself?**
In near future, I want to be someone who is technically solid, reliable & trusted with complex integrations in payroll systems. I see myself learning payroll domain deeply, understand how global systems work across regions.

I seeing how critical and complex payroll is, especially at scale. It's not just about payments, it's about compliance across regions, integrations from multiple systems(HR, ERP).

## **Why should we hire you?**
I am someone with continuous improvement mindset. Even though I have not specifically worked on SAP before, I am adaptable and eager to learn new technologies. Me having already worked with cloud based workflows, I know how cloud services work.

At the same time, I have been actively improving my communication and collaboration skills. As I know this role is not just about fixing things but also explaining them to client across regions. I believe i'll be someone who can deliver both. 

If you hire me, I feel you will be getting someone who is adaptable and can make impactful contribution to the payroll team.
## **What value do you bring?**
I'll bring value by being someone who not only follows instructions but understand how systems work. Ask right questions. I bring mindset of continuous improvement. As i am early in my career, I am flexible and eager to adapt.
## **Why gap?**
I have graduated in 2024 made a clear decision to build real skills in data engineering & cloud technologies before getting into a job. I was offered many sales & bpo roles along the way, But I didn't want to get into anything that wasn't aligned with my career path. 

So, In this time I have a hands-on data engineering bootcamp, worked on projects with Azure and GCP, achieved several certifications. I would say the time i spent wasn't idle. Now, I believe I have skills, mindset to deliver value from day one.

## **About ADP**
ADP is an American based company, It is one of world's leaders in providing payroll and human capital management solutions. It is a tech-driven global platform that handles complex and large scale operations. One of it's products GlobalView is specifically designed for large scale multinational operations.

## **Why join ADP?**
I have spent time researching your company to make sure it was somewhere i would want to work. And found a fact that you are a company with strong workspace values. 

For me, itâ€™s a combination of learning and impact. ADP offering a platform to put my skills and qualities in real time, high stake systems that directly affects people is both challenging and meaningful.
